          <h2>Carrier as a scientist</h2>
          <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
             Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career
              by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.</p>
        <h2>Presidency</h2>
        <p>Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahga
           term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.</p>
           <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[
          At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.
          He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.
          Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST.
          His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
